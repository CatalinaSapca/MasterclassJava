--------------------------------------------Static vs Instance Methods
-static methods are declared using static modifier
-static methods can't access instance methods and instance variables directly

-instance methods belong to an instance of a class
-to use an instance method we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the NEW keyword

Dog dog = new Dog(); // new instance; dog is a reference to a dog instance

------------------------------------------------------Static vs Instance Variables
-static variable can be accesed from outside the class without requiring a instance of that class
 to be created
